I am a researcher interested in mobile robot perception and machine learning. Exploring ways of leveraging weak signals to boostrap the learning of perception towards mobile manipulation piques my interest.

Currently, I work as a research staff member in the [Robotics, Perception, and Manipulation Laboratory](https://rpm-lab.github.io/) lead by [Professor Karthik Desingh](https://karthikdesingh.com/) at the University of Minnesota, Twin-cities.

Prior to that I earned my Masters in Robotics in 2022 and a Bachelors in Computer Engineering in 2017, from University of Michigan. I also worked as a Perception Algorithm Engineer between 2018 and 2020. 

I have had the forture of holding positions at various companies including [The University of Minnesota](https://rpm-lab.github.io/team/), [The University of Michigan](https://robotics.umich.edu/), [Zenuity](), [Toyota](https://amrd.toyota.com/division/ivs/), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), and [ZF](https://www.zf.com/usa_canada/en/home/home.html).
