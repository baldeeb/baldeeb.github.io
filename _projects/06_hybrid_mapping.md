[Introduction to Autonomous Robotics](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/teaching/eecs467-F19.html) - Winter 2018 - Professor Benjamin Kuipers

Implemented SLAM using a hybrid of dense and topological maps on a robot equipped with a single beam LIDAR for the purpose of reducing time complexity and memory usage.

    A cornerstone of my robotics career. This video shows a small robot, equipped with a 2D LIDAR, exploring and mapping corridores of the second floor of the EECS building at the University of Michiang. Every intersection is densely scanned, analyzed to determine viable routes, and then used to close a loop of a topological map linking all intersections.
