  abstract={Estimating 2D-3D correspondences has proven to be a very useful tool
            for category-level pose and scale estimation and robot manipulation tasks; how-
            ever, it is hindered by the difficulty of obtaining 3D object models and labels.
            Simulation reduces the burden of labeling but introduces a gap between the train-
            ing and operational domains. We introduce a novel architecture for integrating
            cross-domain data in the training of NOCS predictors (a form of 2D-3D corre-
            spondences). We leverage Generative-Adversarial-Networks (GANs) to avoid the
            need for burdensome real-data labeling by using a domain-agnostic discrimina-
            tor as a supervisor. This work presents results demonstrating the potential of our
            method.},
